# Cry-Wolf-Server

Basic server for Cry Wolf database. Communicates with MongoDB and creates a local server.
Simply run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' to access the server.
No authenticator currently so you can easily alter the database. Nothing stored in the database is unrecoverable but please don't delete anything intentionally. Feel free to add characters in the meantime.
The local client can be found at https://github.com/jameskendallbruce/Cry-Wolf-Client/
